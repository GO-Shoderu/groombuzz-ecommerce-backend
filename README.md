# GroomBuzz E-Commerce Backend (Project Nexus)

## Overview
GroomBuzz is a **service discovery and listing platform** that connects clients to grooming and self-care services. Similar to property listing or ride-hailing platforms, GroomBuzz allows users to **search, browse, and discover services** based on their needs, while service offerings are organized into structured listings.

This project is a **production-style backend** for GroomBuzz, focusing on a robust **catalog system** that supports managing categories and items (services/products), secure user authentication, and efficient discovery features such as **filtering, sorting, and pagination**.

The implementation is designed for seamless frontend integration.
