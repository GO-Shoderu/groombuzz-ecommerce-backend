# ERD Requirements
Designing an Entity–Relationship Diagram (ERD) for **GroomBuzz**, a two-sided service discovery and booking platform that supports users (clients/business owners/admin), business profiles, service listings, bookings, payments, reviews, and messaging. The ERD identifies entities, attributes, and relationships with clear cardinalities.
